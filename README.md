 **DiscordVerificator** is a **Spigot** plugin that allows you to do player authentication using **Discord bot**.<br>

> [!WARNING]
> This plugin is **intended** to be used on **private servers** with the **manual player addition** because it involves you to manually link each player to their **Discord profile**.

 It was developed as an **alternative** for password-based authorization like `/login <password>` on servers with `online-mode` set to `false` (_in server.properties_).


 ## ðŸ¤” How it works?

This plugin enables players to **link their usernames to their Discord profiles**. <br/>

The **linking process** is **controlled by the administrator** of the server. <br/>
In order **to link** the account, the **admin** should run `/link <Player> <Discord ID>`. ([how to get discord id?](https://youtu.be/RzTWH0g2xbo?si=oQT2rCSuf6B3Z5kY))

Then, **when player joins a server**, the **verification code appears**.<br>
To join the server, the player should run the seen command to the **Discord bot** you've configured: <br>

> [!CAUTION]
> The plugin **will prevent player from joining** if it isn't linked to **Discord** profile yet:
